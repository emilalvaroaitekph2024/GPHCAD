# ClaudeCAD

Your 3D print modeling assistant.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

# TODO:

- Add examples.
- Make message history more robust.
- Deal with 2D shapes not being rendered?
- Go through flow
  - Make sure when pressing "Not correct" it hides next message (or show what you picked?), and if no drawing, use the previous one somehow?
