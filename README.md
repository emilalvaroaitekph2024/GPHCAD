# ClaudeCAD

Your 3D print modeling assistant.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

# TODO:

- Add examples.
- Deal with 2D shapes not being rendered?
- Store history?
- Multiple chats? (e.g. one for each shape, and being able to merge them)
  - Too ambitious for delivery though, but maybe later
- Use reducer on messages to simulate a dynamic progress
- Make video of the app in action
- Deploy to vercel
